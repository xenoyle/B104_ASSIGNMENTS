## Problem 1
# bluffTempF = eval(input("Bluffton Temperature (F): "))
# bluffTempC = (bluffTempF - 32) / (9/5)  # formula: C = (F - 32) / (9/5)
# print(f"The current temperature on the Bluffton campus is {bluffTempF} degrees F ( {round(bluffTempC)} degrees C)")

## Problem 2
# km_per_mile = 1.60934
# miles_between_campuses = 20.41
# km_between_campuses = miles_between_campuses * km_per_mile
# print(f"The distance between the Beaufort and Hilton Head USCB campuses is {miles_between_campuses} miles ( {round(km_between_campuses, 2)} kms).")


# The problems have both been commented, feel free to uncomment for functionality :)
# They were also both done from scratch as promised
